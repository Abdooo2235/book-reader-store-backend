 Create a comprehensive Character class with properties:  
 Basic info: name, description, image  
 Metadata: creation date, last modified  
 Attributes: skills, stats  
 Implement JSON serialization/deserialization  
1.3 AI-Assisted Implementation  
 Use AI tools to generate color palette suggestions  
 Generate initial Character class with AI  
 Document AI prompts used and rationale for selected elements  
Evaluation Criteria (30% of final grade)  
 Implementation of Material Design 3  principles (10%)

 Implement state management for:  
 Character list  
 User preferences (theme)  
 Authentication state  
2.2 Firebase Integration  
 Set up Firebase project with Firestore  
 Implement authentication (email/password)  
 Configure Firestore database with proper data structure  
 Set up Firebase Storage for character images  
2.3 CRUD  Operations  
 Implement all CRUD operations for Character data  
 Add real -time updates using streams  
 Handle network errors and offline scenarios  
2.4 AI -Assisted Implementation  
 Use AI to generate Firestore security rules  
 Create repository classes with AI assist ance  
 Document AI -assisted backend implementation  
Evaluation Criteria (40% of final grade)  
 Correct implementation of state management (15%)  
 Successful Firebase integration (15%)

 Implementation of all required features (10%)  
 
Week 3: Advanced Features & Final Presentation  
Learning Objectives  
 Implement advanced Flutter features  
 Optimize application performance  
 Create comprehensive technical documentation  
 Develop effective presentation skills  
Tasks & Deliverables  
3.1 Feature Implementation (Choose 2 of the following)  
 Search and filtering functionality  
 Character export/import functionality  
 Push notifications for character updates  
 Character sharing capabilities  
3.2 Performance Optimization  
 Implement lazy loading  
 Optimize image loading and caching  
 Reduce app bu ndle size  
3.3 Documentation & Presentation  
 README file with setup instructions  
 5-minute video demonstration of the application  
 Slides explaining technical decisions  
 Reflection on AI usage throughout the project  
 AI Integration Log documenting all AI usage  
Evaluation Criteria (30% of final grade)  
 Implementation of advanced features (15%)  
 Quality of documentation and presentation (15%)  
 
Additional Requirements  
AI Usage Documentation  
Students must maintain an "AI Integration Log" documenting:  

=== PAGE 4 ===
 AI tools used (ChatGPT , GitHub Copilot, etc.)  
 Prompts used and their effectiveness  
 How AI -generated code was modified  
 Challenges encountered with AI assistance  
 Ethical considerations of AI usage  
Submission Requirements  
1. Source code repository with Git history  
2. Technical d ocumentation  
3. AI Integration Log

Academic Integrity Policy  
While AI tools are encouraged for this project, students must:  
1. Clearly document all AI -generated code  
2. Ensure they understand and can explain all code in their project  
3. Not use AI to generate entire solutions without understanding  
4. Cite AI usage appropriately in their documentation  
5. Not use AI to plagiarize or create misleading content  
Any violation of these guidelines will be treated according to the institution's academic 
integrity policy.
